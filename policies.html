RESOLUTION<br>

No. 23/40/2004-R&R (Vol.II)<br><br>

1.0 INTRODUCTION<br>

1.1 In compliance with section 3 of the Electricity Act 2003 the Central Government hereby notifies the National Electricity Policy.<br>

1.2 Electricity is an essential requirement for all facets of our life. It has been recognized as a basic human need. It is a critical infrastructure on which the socio-economic development of the country depends. Supply of electricity at reasonable rate to rural India is essential for its overall development. Equally important is availability of reliable and quality power at competitive rates to Indian industry to make it globally competitive and to enable it to exploit the tremendous potential of employment generation. Services sector has made significant contribution to the growth of our economy. Availability of quality supply of electricity is very crucial to sustained growth of this segment.<br><br>

1.3 Recognizing that electricity is one of the key drivers for rapid economic growth and poverty alleviation, the nation has set itself the target of providing access to all households in next five years. As per Census 2001, about 44% of the households do not have access to electricity. Hence meeting the target of providing universal access is a daunting task requiring significant addition to generation capacity and expansion of the transmission and distribution network.<br><br>

1.4 Indian Power sector is witnessing major changes. Growth of Power Sector in India since its Independence has been noteworthy. However, the demand for power has been outstripping the growth of availability. Substantial peak and energy shortages prevail in the country. This is due to inadequacies in generation, transmission & distribution as well as inefficient use of electricity. Very high level of technical and commercial losses and lack of commercial approach in management of utilities has led to unsustainable financial operations. Cross-subsidies have risen to unsustainable levels. Inadequacies in distribution networks has been one of the major reasons for poor quality of supply.<br><br>

1.5 Electricity industry is capital-intensive having long gestation period. Resources of power generation are unevenly dispersed across the country. Electricity is a commodity that can not be stored in the grid where demand and supply have to be continuously balanced. The widely distributed and rapidly increasing demand requirements of the country need to be met in an optimum manner.
<br><br>
1.6 Electricity Act, 2003 provides an enabling framework for accelerated and more efficient development of the power sector. The Act seeks to encourage competition with appropriate regulatory intervention. Competition is expected to yield efficiency gains and in turn result in availability of quality supply of electricity to consumers at competitive rates.
<br><br>
1.7 Section 3 (1) of the Electricity Act 2003 requires the Central Government to formulate, inter alia, the National Electricity Policy in consultation with Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and State Governments. The provision is quoted below:
<br><br>
"The Central Government shall, from time to time, prepare the National Electricity Policy and tariff policy, in consultation with the State Governments and the Authority for development of the power system based on optimal utilization of resources such as coal, natural gas, nuclear substances or materials, hydro and renewable sources of energy".
<br><br>
Section 3 (3) of the Act enables the Central Government to review or revise the National Electricity Policy from time to time.
<br><br>
1.8 The National Electricity Policy aims at laying guidelines for accelerated development of the power sector, providing supply of electricity to all areas and protecting interests of consumers and other stakeholders keeping in view availability of energy resources, technology available to exploit these resources, economics of generation using different resources, and energy security issues.
<br><br>
1.9 The National Electricity Policy has been evolved in consultation with and taking into account views of the State Governments, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and other stakeholders.
<br><br>
2.0 AIMS & OBJECTIVES
<br><br>
The National Electricity Policy aims at achieving the following objectives:
<br><br>
Access to Electricity - Available for all households in next five years
Availability of Power - Demand to be fully met by 2012. Energy and peaking shortages to be overcome and adequate spinning reserve to be available.
Supply of Reliable and Quality Power of specified standards in an efficient manner and at reasonable rates.<br><br>
Per capita availability of electricity to be increased to over 1000 units by 2012.
Minimum lifeline consumption of 1 unit/household/day as a merit good by year 2012.
Financial Turnaround and Commercial Viability of Electricity Sector.
Protection of consumersâ€™ interests.<br><br><br><br>
3. NATIONAL ELECTRICITY PLAN<br><br>

3.1 Assessment of demand is an important pre-requisite for planning capacity addition. Section 3 (4) of the Act requires the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to frame a National Electricity Plan once in five years and revise the same from time to time in accordance with the National Electricity Policy. Also, section 73 (a) provides that formulation of short-term and perspective plans for development of the electricity system and coordinating the activities of various planning agencies for the optimal utilization of resources to subserve the interests of the national economy shall be one of the functions of the CEA. The Plan prepared by CEA and approved by the Central Government can be used by prospective generating companies, transmission utilities and transmission/distribution licensees as reference document.<br><br>

3.2 Accordingly, the CEA shall prepare short-term and perspective plan. The National Electricity Plan would be for a short-term framework of five years while giving a 15 year perspective and would include:<br><br>

Short-term and long term demand forecast for different regions;<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Suggested areas/locations for capacity additions in generation and transmission keeping in view the economics of generation and transmission, losses in the system, load centre requirements, grid stability, security of supply, quality of power including voltage profile etc. and environmental considerations including rehabilitation and resettlement;
Integration of such possible locations with transmission system and development of national grid including type of transmission systems and requirement of redundancies; and
Different technologies available for efficient generation, transmission and distribution.
Fuel choices based on economy, energy security and environmental considerations.
3.3 While evolving the National Electricity Plan, CEA will consult all the stakeholders including state governments and the state governments would, at state level, undertake this exercise in coordination with stakeholders including distribution licensees and STUs. While conducting studies periodically to assess short-term and long-term demand, projections made by distribution utilities would be given due weightage. CEA will also interact with institutions and agencies having economic expertise, particularly in the field of demand forecasting. Projected growth rates for different sectors of the economy will also be taken into account in the exercise of demand forecasting.<br><br><br><br>

3.4 The National Electricity Plan for the ongoing 10th Plan period and 11th Plan and perspective Plan for the 10th, 11th & 12th Plan periods would be prepared and notified after reviewing and revising the existing Power Plan prepared by CEA. This will be done within six months.
<br><br>

5.1 RURAL ELECTRIFICATION<br><br>

5.1.1 The key development objective of the power sector is supply of electricity to all areas including rural areas as mandated in section 6 of the Electricity Act. Both the central government and state governments would jointly endeavour to achieve this objective at the earliest. Consumers, particularly those who are ready to pay a tariff which reflects efficient costs have the right to get uninterrupted twenty four hours supply of quality power. About 56% of rural households have not yet been electrified even though many of these households are willing to pay for electricity. Determined efforts should be made to ensure that the task of rural electrification for securing electricity access to all households and also ensuring that electricity reaches poor and marginal sections of the society at reasonable rates is completed within the next five years.<br><br>

5.1.2 Reliable rural electrification system will aim at creating the following:<br><br><br><br>

(a) Rural Electrification Distribution Backbone (REDB) with at least one 33/11 kv (or 66/11 kv) substation in every Block and more if required as per load, networked and connected appropriately to the state transmission system<br><br>

(b) Emanating from REDB would be supply feeders and one distribution transformer at least in every village settlement.<br><br>

(c) Household Electrification from distribution transformer to connect every household on demand.
<br><br>
(d) Wherever above is not feasible (it is neither cost effective nor the optimal solution to provide grid connectivity) decentralized distributed generation facilities together with local distribution network would be provided so that every household gets access to electricity. This would be done either through conventional or non-conventional methods of electricity generation whichever is more suitable and economical. Non-conventional sources of energy could be utilized even where grid connectivity exists provided it is found to be cost effective.
<br><br>
(e) Development of infrastructure would also cater for requirement of agriculture & other economic activities including irrigation pump sets, small and medium industries, khadi and village industries, cold chain and social services like health and education.
<br><br><br><br>
5.1.3 Particular attention would be given in household electrification to dalit bastis, tribal areas and other weaker sections.
<br><br>
5.1.4 Rural Electrification Corporation of India, a Government of India enterprise will be the nodal agency at Central Government level to implement the programme for achieving the goal set by National Common Minimum Programme of giving access to electricity to all the households in next five years. Its role is being suitably enlarged to ensure timely implementation of rural electrification projects.
<br><br>
5.1.5 Targetted expansion in access to electricity for rural households in the desired timeframe can be achieved if the distribution licensees recover at least the cost of electricity and related O&M expenses from consumers, except for lifeline support to households below the poverty line who would need to be adequately subsidized. Subsidies should be properly targeted at the intended beneficiaries in the most efficient manner. Government recognizes the need for providing necessary capital subsidy and soft long-term debt finances for investment in rural electrification as this would reduce the cost of supply in rural areas. Adequate funds would need to be made available for the same through the Plan process. Also commensurate organizational support would need to be created for timely implementation. The Central Government would assist the State Governments in achieving this.
<br><br>
5.1.6 Necessary institutional framework would need to be put in place not only to ensure creation of rural electrification infrastructure but also to operate and maintain supply system for securing reliable power supply to consumers. Responsibility of operation & maintenance and cost recovery could be discharged by utilities through appropriate arrangements with Panchayats, local authorities, NGOs and other franchisees etc.
<br><br>
5.1.7 The gigantic task of rural electrification requires appropriate cooperation among various agencies of the State Governments, Central Government and participation of the community. Education and awareness programmes would be essential for creating demand for electricity and for achieving the objective of effective community participation.
